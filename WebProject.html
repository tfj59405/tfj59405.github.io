<h1> The Braves Final Season at Turner Field  </h1>
<p> The Atlanta Braves played their final season at Turner Field in 2016, and it was a memorable one. 
 For more information, feel free to take a look around <a href= "http://www.braves.com">The Braves website</a>, which provides a wealth of information about the team. 
 In many ways, the 2016 team was a tale of two seasons. On the one hand, the first 100 or so games of the season the 
 Braves played their worst baseball in team history. And keep in mind that the Atlanta Braves are the <em> oldest</em> team in 
the sport (established in 1871) so that really is quite pathetic. But the glass is half full in the sense that the future of 
the team played the remainder of the season after the abysmal start, and the young players did a fantastic job.
It was an emotional goodbye to the Braves' stadium, Turner Field, which has been the home of the Braves since 1997. 
Looking forward, the Braves will be moving to SunTrust Park in nearby Cobb county for the 2017 season.
Now let's break down the major components of the Braves roster. </p>
<hr>
<h2 style="font-size:175%"> Position Players </h2>
<p> The Braves' position players last season were <S>not among the best</S> the 
worst hitters in the league. That being said, they were the bright spot on a shaky team. Freddie Freeman, the team's captain,
put up an MVP caliber season in 2016. He notched 34 home runs, while hitting to the tune of a .302 batting average. The Braves offense
received a needed <b>jolt</b> in August when the team traded for All-Star Matt Kemp. The aging star seemed rejuvenated when he was traded to
his hometown team (Kemp is from Atlanta originally) and he was a top slugger through the remainder of the season. Perhaps the most exciting
player of the 2016 campaign was rookie shortstop Dansby Swanson, whose fast baserunning and exemplary defense allowed him to quickly become
the talk of the league. With more young prospects coming up next year, the Braves seem poised to have elite position players heading into next season.  </p></div>

 <h3 style="font-family:cursive"> Pitchers </h3>
<p> The Braves pitchers in 2016 were an abomination. Well perhaps that's too harsh of a word. Like the position players
they showed signs of life during parts of the season, but there is no doubt that pitching was the weakness of the 2016 team.
The problem was that the Braves called up many pitchers from the minor leagues who clearly were not ready for MLB level competition.
The Braves Ace, Julio Teheran, turned in a fine season as he led the very young starting rotation. Mike Foltynewicz, the young fireballer, 
had a very encouraging season, striking out many batters with his 98 MPH fastball and devastating slider. On the other hand, Matt Wisler took 
a step back from his 2015 season, seeming to regress heavily in his sophomore season. All in all, despite the struggles, the young 
Braves pitchers should be more developed heading into next season, hopefully contributing to possible playoff team. </p>
